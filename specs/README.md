# Runspecs
A runspec defines all the settings for a single run.
To execute any of the runspecs in this directory (with **wmg_agent** as the current directory), type:

    python run.py specs/<runspec>

## BabyAI runspecs

## Pathfinding runspecs

### test_pathfinding_wmg.py

Loads **models/pathfinding_wmg.pth** (one of the 100 WMG agent models trained on 20M environment interactions),
then tests the agent on 1000 random episodes.
The reward per step should be around 0.498, which is 99.6% of possible reward.

## Sokoban runspecs

### test_sokoban.py

Loads **models/sokoban.pth** (one of the 20 WMG agent models trained on 20M environment interactions),
then tests the agent on the official [test set](../data/boxoban-levels-master/unfiltered/test) of 1000 puzzles.
The success rate should be around 84%.

### train_sokoban.py

Trains a new WMG agent on Sokoban puzzles drawn randomly from the [train set](../data/boxoban-levels-master/unfiltered/train),
which contains 10k puzzles.
In order to train an agent on the full train set of 900k puzzles, 
first copy all 900 files from [https://github.com/deepmind/boxoban-levels](https://github.com/deepmind/boxoban-levels) 
into the [train set directory](../data/boxoban-levels-master/unfiltered/train).

### render_sokoban.py

This loads **models/sokoban.pth**
and displays a series of Sokoban puzzles drawn randomly from the [train set](../data/boxoban-levels-master/unfiltered/train).
* To interact with the display: 
     * Use the arrow keys to choose the agent's move.
     * Press **space** to let the agent choose the next move.
     * Press **N** to skip to the next puzzle.
     * Press **Esc** to exit.
