# Working Memory Graphs
This repository is provided to assist in reproducing results from 
the paper [Working Memory Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07141)
published at ICML 2020.


## Installation steps
* The code has been tested with Python 3.6, on both Windows and Linux.
* Clone this repository.
* Create a new virtual environment.
* Activate the environment.
* Install PyTorch 1.3.1.
* Install other dependencies:
	* cd wmg_agent
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
* Install BabyAI:
	* conda install -c conda-forge python-blosc
	* git clone -b iclr19 https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git
	* cd babyai
	* pip install --user --editable .


# Run commands

Execute all run commands from the **wmg_agent** directory, using this format:

    python run.py <runspec>

Use the runspecs in the [spec](specs) directory to reproduce results from the paper.
Create new runspecs for new experiments.
